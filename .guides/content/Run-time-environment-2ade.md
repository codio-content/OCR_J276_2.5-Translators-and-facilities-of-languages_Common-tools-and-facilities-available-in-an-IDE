The run-time environment allows the program to be run inside the IDE e.g. when using the ‘step-by-step’ facility above.
In order to do this the IDE has a translator (see lesson 1).

IDEs also include **auto documentation** that allows the automatic documentation of all the variables and modules in a text file. This is especially useful when teams of programmers are working on the same project to ensure that they all understand the coding.
