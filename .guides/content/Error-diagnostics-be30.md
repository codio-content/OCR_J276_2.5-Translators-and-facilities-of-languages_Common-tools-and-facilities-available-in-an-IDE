This tool assists the programmer in debugging the code and removing errors. Facilities include:

**Step by step or single-stepping**
This allows the code to be run and inspected one line at a time. It allows the effects of a single statement or instruction to be evaluated in isolation.

**Breakpoints or pauses**
Breakpoints, or pauses, allow the intentional stopping of the program at a specified place so that the programmer can inspect the code and see if the program is functioning as expected up to that point.

**Variable tracing**
This feature allows the programmer to see the values of variables at any stage in the running of the program. The programmer can see if the values are as expected.
